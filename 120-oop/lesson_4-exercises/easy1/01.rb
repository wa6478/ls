# Question 1

# Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, how can you find out what class they belong to?

# true => object from the TrueClass class
# "hello" => object from the String class
# [1, 2, 3, "happy days"] => object from the Array class
# 142 => object from the Fixnum class

# all of the above are objects

# you can find out what Class an object belongs to with the `#class` method
