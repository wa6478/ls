# Question 8

# If we have this class:

class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

# And another class:

class Bingo
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end

# What can we add to the Bingo class to allow it to inherit the play method from the Game class?

# A: class Bingo < Game
# to make it a subclass of Game

# Question 9

# If we have this class:

class Game
  def play
    "Start the game!"
  end
end

class Bingo < Game
  def rules_of_play
    #rules of play
  end
end

# What would happen if we added a play method to the Bingo class, keeping in mind that there is already a method of this name in the Game class that the Bingo class inherits from.

# Bingo would use the instance method defined within its own class, as its earlier in the method lookup chain
