# Question 5

# Alyssa asked Ben to write up a basic implementation of a Fibonacci calculator, A user passes in two numbers, and the calculator will keep computing the sequence until some limit is reached.

# Ben coded up this implementation but complained that as soon as he ran it, he got an error. Something about the limit variable. What's wrong with the code?

# limit = 15

# def fib(first_num, second_num)
#   while second_num < limit
#     sum = first_num + second_num
#     first_num = second_num
#     second_num = sum
#   end
#   sum
# end

# result = fib(0, 1)
# puts "result is #{result}"
# How would you fix this so that it works?

# reason why it throws an error is that the limit variable is out of scope from the method, and therefore the method doesn't have access to it
# would simply add an additional argument to the method

limit = 15

def fib(first_num, second_num, limit)
  while second_num < limit
    sum = first_num + second_num
    first_num = second_num
    second_num = sum
  end
  sum
end

result = fib(0, 1, limit)
puts "result is #{result}"
