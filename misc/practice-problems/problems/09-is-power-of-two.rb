# Write a method that takes in a number and returns true if it is a
# power of 2. Otherwise, return false.
#
# You may want to use the `%` modulo operation. `5 % 2` returns the
# remainder when dividing 5 by 2; therefore, `5 % 2 == 1`. In the case
# of `6 % 2`, since 2 evenly divides 6 with no remainder, `6 % 2 == 0`.
#
# Difficulty: medium.

# in: integer
# out: boolean
# - check if it's a power of two
#   - 1**2, 2**2, 3**2, 4**2 << all powers of two
#   - basically, see if the number is a square with no remainder
#   - alternate way to take square root is to the power of (1/2)

def is_power_of_two?(num)
  return false if num == 0
  num % num**(0.5) == 0
end

# These are tests to check that your code is working. After writing
# your solution, they should all print true.
