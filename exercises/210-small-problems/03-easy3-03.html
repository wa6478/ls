// When Will I Retire

// Build a program that logs when the user will retire and how many years the user has to work till retirement.

// Example:

// What is your age? 30
// At what age would you like to retire? 70

// It's 2016. You will retire in 2056.
// You have only 40 years of work to go!

var age = parseInt(prompt('What is your age?'), 10);
var retirementAge = parseInt(prompt('What age would you like to retire?'), 10);
var currentYear = new Date(Date.now()).getFullYear();
var yearsUntilRetirement = retirementAge - age;
var retirementYear = currentYear + yearsUntilRetirement;

console.log('It\'s ' + currentYear + '. You will retire in ' + retirementYear + '.');
console.log('You have only ' + yearsUntilRetirement + ' years of work to go!');
