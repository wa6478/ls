# Poker

# Write an algorithm to pick the best poker hand(s) from a list.

# See wikipedia for an overview of poker hands. For this exercise, you don't have to consider wild cards.

# Focus to get the tests below to pass. We're using 2 letters to represent a poker card - the first letter is the rank of the card, represented by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, and A. The second letter is the suit of the card, represented by S, H, C and D (Spades, Hearts, Clubs and Diamonds). For example, "8D" means eight of diamonds, "TH" means ten of hearts, and "AS" means ace of spades.
