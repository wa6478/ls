# Simple Linked List

# Write a simple linked list implementation that uses Elements and a List.

# The linked list is a fundamental data structure in computer science, often used in the implementation of other data structures.

# The simplest kind of linked list is a singly linked list. Each element in the list contains data and a "next" field pointing to the next element in the list of elements. This variant of linked lists is often used to represent sequences or push-down stacks (also called a LIFO stack; Last In, First Out).

# Lets create a singly linked list to contain the range (1..10), and provide functions to reverse a linked list and convert to and from arrays.
