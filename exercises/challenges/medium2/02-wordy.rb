# Wordy

# Write a program that takes a word problem and returns the answer as an integer.

# E.g.

# What is 5 plus 13?

# The program should return 18.

# What is 7 minus 5 minus 1?

# The program should return 1.

# Remember, that these are verbal word problems, not treated as you normally would treat a written problem. This means that you calculate as you move forward each step. This means 3 + 2 * 3 = 15, not 9.

# Hint: to solve this problem elegantly, you need to know how the send method works in Ruby. If you haven't seen it before, check it out here.
