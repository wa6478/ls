# Pet Shelter

# Consider the following code:

class Pet
  attr_reader :type, :name

  def initialize(type, name)
    @type = type
    @name = name
  end

  def to_s
    "a #{type} named #{name}"

  attr_reader :name, :adopted

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
    @adopted = []
  end

  def <<(pet)
    @adopted << pet
  end

  def number_of_pets
    adopted.count
  end

  def print_pets
    adopted.each { |pet| puts pet }
  end
end

class Shelter
  attr_reader :adoptions

  def initialize
    @adoptions = []
  end

  def adopt(owner, pet)
    owner << pet
    @adoptions << owner
  end

  def print_adoptions
    adoptions.uniq.each do |owner|
      puts "#{owner.name} has adopted the following pets:"
      owner.print_pets
    end
  end
end


butterscotch = Pet.new('cat', 'Butterscotch')

kennedy      = Pet.new('dog', 'Kennedy')
sweetie      = Pet.new('parakeet', 'Sweetie Pie')
molly        = Pet.new('dog', 'Molly')
chester      = Pet.new('fish', 'Chester')

shelter.print_adoptions
puts "#{phanson.name} has #{phanson.number_of_pets} adopted pets."
puts "#{bholmes.name} has #{bholmes.number_of_pets} adopted pets."

# Write the classes and methods that will be necessary to make this code run, and print the following output:

# P Hanson has adopted the following pets:
# a cat named Butterscotch
# a cat named Pudding
# a bearded dragon named Darwin

# B Holmes has adopted the following pets:
# a dog named Molly
# a parakeet named Sweetie Pie
# a dog named Kennedy
# a fish named Chester

# P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
# B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.
# The order of the output does not matter, so long as all of the information is presented.
