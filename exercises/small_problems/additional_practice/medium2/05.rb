# Triangle Sides

# A triangle is classified as follows:

# equilateral All 3 sides are of equal length
# isosceles 2 sides are of equal length, while the 3rd is different
# scalene All 3 sides are of different length
# To be a valid triangle, the sum of the lengths of the two shortest sides must be greater than the length of the longest side, and all sides must have lengths greater than 0: if either of these conditions is not satisfied, the triangle is invalid.

# Write a method that takes the lengths of the 3 sides of a triangle as arguments, and returns a symbol :equilateral, :isosceles, :scalene, or :invalid depending on whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles, scalene, or invalid.

# Examples:

def triangle(a, b, c)
  sides = a, b, c
  case
  when sides.any? { |side| side.zero? }
    :invalid
  when sides.any? { |side| sides.reduce(:+) - side < side }
    :invalid
  when sides.all? { |side| side == sides.first }
    :equilateral
  when sides == sides.uniq
    :scalene
  else
    :isosceles
  end
end

puts triangle(3, 3, 3) == :equilateral
puts triangle(3, 3, 1.5) == :isosceles
puts triangle(3, 4, 5) == :scalene
puts triangle(0, 3, 3) == :invalid
puts triangle(3, 1, 1) == :invalid
