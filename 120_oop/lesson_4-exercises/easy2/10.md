Question 10

What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

- Grouping together functionality into common spaces, allowing for thoughtful creation of code
- Easier to digest the logic in smaller chunks, rather than always having to consider the program as a whole
- Creating flexibility by allowing you to add functionality without necessarily having to rewrite a lot of other code
- Easier to debug as a program grows, as the classes narrow down where things may be going wrong
- Easier to explain what the program is supposed to accomplish to somebody else -- creating classes and objects forces you to understand what those classes and objects are supposed to be able to do
- Approach is generally more 'human', objects that have properties (state) and can do things (behaviors) are metaphors that are easier to reason about
- Allows one to think of your program in more physical terms, the lego blocks you want to use in order to build what you're trying to build
