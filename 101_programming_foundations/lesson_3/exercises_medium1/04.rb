# Question 4

# Alyssa was asked to write an implementation of a rolling buffer. Elements are added to the rolling buffer and if the buffer becomes full, then new elements that are added will displace the oldest elements in the buffer.

# She wrote two implementations saying, "Take your pick. Do you like << or + for modifying the buffer?". Is there a difference between the two, other than what operator she chose to use to add an element to the buffer?

def rolling_buffer1(buffer, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer << new_element
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

def rolling_buffer2(input_array, max_buffer_size, new_element)
  buffer = input_array + [new_element]
  buffer.shift if buffer.size > max_buffer_size
  buffer
end

# yes the difference is that concatenation with '+' does not mutate the caller, whereas '<<' does
# imagine that '<<' is preferable in this case, as it keeps using the same object (mutating it), rather than creating a new object every time with buffer being pointed at it instead of the previous object
