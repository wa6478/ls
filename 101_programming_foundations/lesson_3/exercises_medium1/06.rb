# Question 6

# In an earlier exercise we saw that depending on variables to be modified by called methods can be tricky:

def tricky_method(a_string_param, an_array_param)
  a_string_param += "rutabaga"
  an_array_param << "rutabaga"
  
  return a_string_param, an_array_param
end

my_string = "pumpkins"
my_array = ["pumpkins"]
p my_string, my_array = tricky_method(my_string, my_array)

puts "My string looks like this now: #{my_string}"
puts "My array looks like this now: #{my_array}"

# We learned that whether the above "coincidentally" does what we think we wanted "depends" upon what is going on inside the method.

# How can we refactor this exercise to make the result easier to predict and easier for the next programmer to maintain?
